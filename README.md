Overview
This project is a Java-based implementation of a task scheduling system that uses Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Topological Sort to schedule tasks based on their dependencies. Inspired by course scheduling problems, this algorithm ensures that tasks (or courses) are executed in the correct order, respecting prerequisites and dependencies.

The project provides a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and scheduling tasks, making it an efficient tool for individuals and teams to organize their workflows.

Features
Task Management: Create, edit, and delete tasks with details such as title, description, and priority.

Task Categories: Categorize tasks based on projects, work, or personal activities.

Dependency Management: Specify task dependencies to ensure tasks are executed in the correct order.

Topological Sort: Use DFS and BFS algorithms to generate a valid sequence of tasks.

User-Friendly Interface: Built using Java Swing for an intuitive and responsive experience.
