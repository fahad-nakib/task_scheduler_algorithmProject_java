# Overview
This project is a Java-based implementation of a task scheduling system that uses Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Topological Sort to schedule tasks based on their dependencies. Inspired by course scheduling problems, this algorithm ensures that tasks (or courses) are executed in the correct order, respecting prerequisites and dependencies.
